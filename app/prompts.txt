>>> 02_data_preprocessing

Categorize the column “CumOil12Month” in the given dataset into "High", "Medium", and "Low" and call the new column "CumOil_Category".
Make it so that the lowest 90% of the data is classified as "Low", the next highest 5% is classified as "Medium," 
and the highest 5% is classified as "High."
"CumOil12Month" is the target variable.

Handle missing values.
Normalize the data. 
Encode categorical variables. Use ordinal encoding.
Perform feature selection.
Perform feature engineering.
Do data transformation.
Handle outliers.

(REPEATED) Categorize the column “CumOil_12Month” in the given dataset into "High", "Medium", and "Low" and call the new column "CumOil_Category".
Make it so that the lowest 90% of the data is classified as "Low", the next highest 5% is classified as "Medium," 
and the highest 5% is classified as "High."

The dataset is imbalanced. CumOil_Category is 90% "Low", 5% "Medium", and 5% "High." 
Can you write code to address this imbalance using sklearn's resample? Name the result dataframe "df".

Did you name the result dataframe "df"?

run code: df = pd.read_csv('df.csv')

train model: Build a classification model to predict CumOil_Category. Generate the code to train the model. Use a Random Forest.
Don't convert categorical variables. 

You did get_dummies on CumOil_Category which converted that categorical column into one hot encoding 
so that column name is no longer available.

Can you generate model evaluation metrics and interpretations?
Can you give me code to report these metrics but display them in my Streamlit app?

Can you use classification_report to report numbers and display in my Streamlit app?

Can you give me the feature importance in a chart that can be displayed in my Streamlit app?

>>> Features to build with more time

Auto execute code. While loop, send error message back as prompt and iterate until code is executed successfully.
Display feature importance chart in a clearer way.
Ability to save models and load them at any time.   
Better UI/styling.
Modularize code.
